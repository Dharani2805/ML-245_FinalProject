Abstract
Loan repayment delays can result in significant losses for banks, necessitating accurate loan outcome prediction. 
The objective is to accurately predict whether a loan will be fully repaid or charged off, enabling the bank to make informed 
decisions and potentially deny loans with a high likelihood of charge off. Predictions are made based on features such as current 
loan amounts, credit scores, and annual income using a World Bank bank loan dataset. To achieve the project objectives, three machine 
learning models are used: random forest, logistic regression, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models are well-suited for 
classification tasks and have found widespread use in loan prediction. Each model makes use of the available dataset and takes a 
distinct algorithmic approach to uncover patterns and relationships between features and loan outcomes. Model performance is evaluated 
using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, ROC, and log loss. After hyperparameter tuning, the XGBoost model outperforms 
the others, with an F1 score of 0.89, AUC of 0.94, Log Loss of 0.25, Recall of 0.965, accuracy of 0.8750 and Precision of 0.843. 
As a result, the XGBoost model is widely regarded as the most effective in classifying incoming unseen data, thereby assisting banks in 
determining loan approvals for customers.â€ƒ
